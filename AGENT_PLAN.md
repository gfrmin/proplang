# AGENT_PLAN — the re-derivation boundary

**Status: DRAFT by the builder. Binding only on the author's signed tag.**
Nothing under `test/`, `audit/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `MANIFEST.sha256`, `membrane-wire.md`,
`HOSTS_PLAN.md`, `interface.md`, `typed-port-spec.md`, or any `test-*/` moves until that
tag exists. Repo clean, manifest 81/81, as of this draft.

**SIGNED at `agent-boundary` (`f46e08c`), re-tagged `agent-boundary-r1` (the §5d R-D22
re-tag). As of the design-review gate (2026-07-15): steps 0–1 CLOSED (progress register at
§7's head); manifest 83/83 at `code-freeze-r1`. Amendments below marked "ruled 2026-07-15"
were applied under the author's recorded delegation (`AGENT_PLAN_REVIEW.md` Appendix C);
their R-D22 re-tag rides step 2's freeze.**

**Everything below is quoted from the author, copied from the repository, or executed and
measured. Nothing is asserted.** Where the builder was wrong, the reversal is marked and the
old claim is left visible.

**The author must rule on three things before signing:**

| | | |

## 0. The verdict

`brief.md` §2 predicted this failure in the author's own words:

> "There is a language for Bayesian decision theory, and there is a language for a
> Bayesian decision-theoretic *agent*, and the gap between them is the entire difficulty.
> **Get this distinction wrong and you will build the first while believing you have built
> the second.** A language for decision theory is a **calculator**."

That is what was built. **The design was right; the implementation lost the ontology.**

### The chain, each link with provenance

| # | fact | where |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Savage's **theorem** `R(a,s) = u(a(s))` installed as the **definition** of EU | `tests_acceptance.py:51-56`, seed commit `c245c00` |
| 2 | ⇒ utility indexed by ACT ⇒ `Choice` is its domain ⇒ **totality demands a number for `think`** | `Syntax.hs:317`; `HOSTS_PLAN.md:355` *"so the table must cover it"* |
| 3 | ⇒ a number was invented. **`H` is defined nowhere in this repository.** | `membrane-wire.md:131`; `:56` *"give it a dominated sentinel row"* |
| 4 | ⇒ its float residue became the decision signal — VOI computed **negative**; Jensen violated in the machine | measured, 2026-07-11 |
| 5 | **The action space is priced at ZERO.** `Membrane.hs` never imports `bits`; **no `Choice`/`Affordance`/`Slot`/`AffId` value has a description length anywhere.** The policy costs the same for 1 affordance or 10,000. | whole-repo sweep, 2026-07-12 |
| 6 | ⇒ head-on violation of brief §5 — *"**The alphabet of the language IS the prior.**"* **There is no Kraft budget over actions at all.** | brief §5 |
| 7 | **Ruling M5** — forbidding the two priced surfaces from EVER unifying — is **asserted four times and derived zero times.** *"Stops a fourth flow entering through the pricing door"* is never unpacked. | `MEMBRANE_PLAN.md:34-38`, `typed-port-spec.md:196-202`, ×2 more |
| 8 | VOI became **three priced primitives** — the brief's own named example of the forbidden move — at **+0.4854 bits on every stdlib call** | `VThink`/`VThinkK`/`VPre` |
| 9 | …and on the production wire **they are never called**. `think` is decided by the constant. | `BRIEF_AUDIT.md:159-163` *"reached by test harnesses only"* |

**The silence.** Across 86 commits, ~40 documents, two signed external reviews, a
brief-conformance audit that stamped the sentinel **CONFORMANT**, and a cross-audit citing
Savage three times — **no one, on any date, asked what utility is a function of.** The
apparatus was pointed at everything downstream of `data Util a y`. Never at that line: it
arrived on day zero as a *port*, and the increment protocol only scrutinises *changes*.

---

## 1. The author's axioms (2026-07-12)

- **A1** — an action's value is `E[ΔU]`: the change in the utility of the world state.
  One term. *"Affordances don't have utilities; world states do."*
  **⚠️ SCOPED BY RIDER 1**: as built, `E[ΔU]` is **one tick's Δ**. A consequence landing at
  `t+5` is **visible to learning and invisible to choice.** See §9 OPEN 8.
- **A2** — the consequence of an action can never be **known**, only **believed**. The
  transition model is a **hypothesis**: priced, updated by `cond`, learned.
- **A3** — *"all we get are observations/features anyway."* The world's state `s` is **not
  in the agent's ontology**; `PureWorld s` is simulator scaffolding.
- **A4** — *"the actions taken are just more features (although unlike most features
  they're known because you took them)."*
- **A5** — **AMENDED BY RIDER 4 (2026-07-12), to its structural form.** As first worded —
  *"doing nothing must ALWAYS be available"* — **it overclaimed, and §5c does not deliver it.**
  What §5c delivers, and all it delivers, is:
  > **Some act is ALWAYS structurally available, with no sentinel and no world handshake** —
  > so **`argmax` is total** and the metareasoning regress terminates in **the clock, not a
  > threshold**. *That* is the load-bearing property, and it holds.
  **What is NOT delivered: that the always-available act means *nothing happens*.** A world
  declaring `fire :| [stand_down]` makes the first grid point a **launch**. **Inaction semantics
  is delegated to world authors** — lawful (world content is physics; cf.
  [[deletion-test-core-vs-world]]) but **a convention relocated across the membrane, not
  abolished.** Named in §9 OPEN 11, not quietly narrowed.
- **A6** — *"we can never know an action CAUSED something; that's also a hypothesis."*
  **⚠️ RIDER 3 SCOPES ITS CONSEQUENCE**: A6 stands as an **epistemic** axiom. The inference the
  builder drew from it — *"therefore no `do()`, and push-at-assignment is the right scoring
  rule"* — is a **decision-theoretic** claim A6 does not license. **Downgraded RULED → OPEN**;
  see §3 and §9 OPEN 9.
- **A7** — **heuristics may be optimal actions** under Bayesian decision theory, once
  computation is priced.

A2 is what makes metareasoning automatic — and it is precisely what `interface.md`'s
load-bearing clause forbade. Both A1 and A2 are already in brief §7, in symbols:
`E[Δvalue | action] − cost(action)`. The port **flattened** that into one table
`u(action, state)`, and once fused, `think` needs a fabricated payoff. That is the defect.

## 1b. THE OPTIMISATION LAW (author, 2026-07-12)

> *"Optimisations can exploit structure but never live in the prior."*

**The repository already calls this "the doctrine" — in three places — and never made it a law.**

| # | where | words |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `test-expfam/ExpFam.hs:206-209` | *"expansion agreement — **CL-4 for the basis** (plan E7): the **executed fast form is legal iff extensionally equal to the generic family** … **enforced here, not trusted**"* |
| 2 | `Syntax.hs:304-306` | *"Executed semantics is the recorded **fast form**; the expfam expansion is the **property-enforced contract** (E7 — **CL-4's doctrine at the name layer**)"* |
| 3 | `Syntax.hs:386-388` | *"the **E7 doctrine at the pricer** — `bits` and `bitsIn` are one arithmetic, one tree, no drift"* |

Stated as law:

> **Any evaluator fast path is legal iff a property pins it, extensionally, to the general
> route. Enforced, never trusted. It buys speed, never semantics — and it never enters the
> alphabet, so it never touches the prior.**

**`Bern` is the law's one live violation, and its own comment convicts it.** Sighting 2 says in
so many words that the *fast form* is what **executes** and the general family is merely the
*contract* — and then `Bern` sits **in `StdName`**, charging a codeword, **inside the prior**.
It grew `STDNAME` 4 → 5 (now **7**). Under the law: **`bernFast` (`Eval.hs:179`) survives as an
evaluator fast path — zero speed lost — and `Bern` leaves the alphabet.** E7 is already its pin.
Refund: **lg 7 − lg 6 = 0.222 bits on every stdlib mention, forever.**

### Audit of every fast path in the engine

| fast path | exploits | pinned by | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bernFast` (`Eval.hs:179`) | the logit/expfam shape | **E7 `propExpansion`** (`test-expfam/ExpFam.hs:208`) | ✅ **the model** — pinned, enforced |
| the `cond` engine (`Belief.hs:158-188`) | — (it **is** the general route) | **CL-4** (`test/Properties.hs:64-107`) | ⚠️ **gate ~360,000× too wide** — §2b |
| `observeCounts` (`Enumerate.hs:680`; the cite was `:649` when this table was drafted — corrected at the step-2 enactment, register 6.4) | **sufficiency** (batch collapse) | **nothing.** `test-d/D.hs:1041` tests only that the *wire syntax parses* — until step 2's `test-optlaw` | ❌ → ✅ **pinned at the step-2 freeze** |
| the `PilotEU` selection fold (`Membrane.hs` `interpretPilot`, landed step 6; row entered at the step-6 r1; verdict re-ruled at r2) | host-side per-candidate iteration — the per-candidate `predictive (feats ++ a)` read is a read of the agent's OWN meta-state, which the Expr language lacks BY DESIGN (reflexivity is step 10's subject), so the doctrinal `argmaxEU` program cannot express the re-read | **test-stream g2, the bridge row** (runMembrane's choice == the public per-assignment EU arithmetic, every tick; strict `>` displaces = the Argmax evaluator's own tie discipline) + **g6** (argmax-optimality, affine invariance). **TWO citing consumers registered at the step-7 sitting (D-c7 rider 2): the membrane's own PilotEU arm AND the driver's decision loop (PropLang.Host serveLine, step 7) — any future change to g2 has the WIRE in its blast radius.** | ⏳ **CLASSIFICATION DEFERRED TO STEP 10** (the author's r2 direction: finish the language first). NOT an optimization — no in-language route exists today to accelerate. At reflexive closure the question is decided with full information: sayable selector => a true §1b fast path with g2 already its pin; not sayable => the membrane-side general route, permanent. |

**`observeCounts` is a semantic fast path with a syntax test.** It collapses a batch to
`(n₁, n₀)` — legal only because the bern code *happens* to have a sufficient statistic. Today
that is guaranteed by the alphabet. Under §2a it will not be, so the pin stops being optional:
**`observeCounts` ≡ `n₁` then `n₀` repeated `observe`s becomes a REQUIRED property.**

---

## 2. What survives, and what was right all along

**WITHDRAWN — these clauses STAND, and the audit's first pass was wrong to attack them:**

- **`interface.md:37-43`, the load-bearing clause.** *"Consequences arrive inside F_{t+1};
  there is no return value."* **Correct.** Consequences *are* observations. **The error was
  never the channel — it was that nothing valued lived at the other end of it.**
- **CL-6, "the self arrives as names like any other."** Right and sufficient. It was simply
  never switched on.
- **`test/Acceptance.hs` in its entirety.** Its `argmaxEU` is polymorphic and never mentions
  `Choice`. **The inference side of this project is excellent and is not in question.**

---

## 2a. The likelihood is a CODE — and the engine has always been one

The author asked for something *"more general / principled / foundational"* than the exponential
family. There is exactly one floor, and **the engine is already standing on it without knowing.**

> **A likelihood is a CODE.** `P(y | x) ∝ 2^{−L(x,y)}` — where `L` is an ordinary priced
> expression: **the code length of outcome `y` in context `x`. The same principle as the prior.**

**Nothing is more foundational, by Kraft**: every distribution *is* a code and every code *is* a
distribution, **bijectively**. This is not a restriction — it is a **reparameterisation**, and no
generality is ever lost. That is what makes it the floor rather than a choice.

**Every likelihood in the engine already routes through `fromBits`** — declared at
`Belief.hs:133-135` as *"the prior `2^(-|program|)` … **This is the ONLY place a prior comes
from**"*. `ExpFam` (`Eval.hs:116-119`) is nothing but `fromBits` fed a **hardcoded shape of code
length**; its own comment admits *"fromBits absorbs the log-partition A(η) in its
normalization."*

And the decisive one. **`walkOn` (`Enumerate.hs:342-358`) — the record's "one recorded non-expfam
member" — IS ALREADY `2^{−L}`**, hard zeros and all, and **its own comment says so**:

> *"a point with no position has mass 0, i.e. **infinite description length through `fromBits` —
> the measure's own off-support statement**"*

**Somebody wrote the general solution, called it a special case, and shelved it.**

### T1 dissolves

`EXPFAM_PLAN.md:68-80` proved that `rw` is **not** an exponential family: *"an expfam's support is
the base measure's, **fixed for the family**; the reflected walk has source-dependent hard zeros."*
**That proof is true about exponential families and irrelevant to this engine, which never used
one.** A code assigns **∞ bits** to what it does not cover — not a special case, **the
definition**. Verified end to end: `Bits (1/0)` → `fromBits` → `−∞` → `lse` short-circuits
(`Belief.hs:86-88`) → weight **exactly 0**; `orImpossible` fires only when *all* mass is zero,
which is the correct error. **There is no base measure to fight, because there is no base
measure.**

### Why the generality is not frightening

An arbitrary finite kernel is expressible as a code **table** — `O(|x|·|y|)` bits. A licence for
nonsense? **No: the prior handles it.** A structured code costs `O(1)`. **`bern` wins over the
table because it is SHORTER, not because we forbade the table.** That is brief §8's method —
*"the complexity prior does the model selection; **you do nothing**"* — applied to **likelihoods**
for the first time.

**Cut, each a shape of a code, not a primitive:** `ExpFam`, `Stats`, `SId`, `Carrier`, **`Bern`**
(§1b), **`rw` / `THmm` / `MHmm`**, `Terminal`, `Model`. **A hypothesis becomes a sentence** — now
possible at last, *because `rw` is finally sayable.*

**The one honest casualty: sufficiency dies as a GUARANTEE.** `test-expfam` group 6
(`propSufficiency`) is **false for an arbitrary code**. Under §1b this is the right trade and
**costs no speed**: sufficiency survives as *structure the evaluator may recognise* — so
`observeCounts` keeps collapsing bern-shaped batches — but never as an *alphabet guarantee*. The
price of the trade is that it must now be **pinned**, and today it is not.

---

## 2b. STOP AND REPORT — the `1e-9` in CL-4 (a frozen test is wrong)

`test/Properties.hs:85` and `:107`, **frozen since Phase 1**:

```haskell
(abs (lhs - rhs) <= 1e-9 * (1 + abs rhs))
```

**It is the only tolerance of its magnitude in the repository.** Every value pin in every later
suite is `1e-12`; `test-govhost/GovHost.hs:132` names it — *"C10's standard for value pins over
frozen-verb compositions."* `test/Anchors.hs`'s `1e-6` / `1e-4` each carry a written margin. And
**the `0.02` in this very file carries a five-line provenance paragraph** (*"observed maximum
0.0025 bits/obs … **8x headroom** … delta is part of the oracle and **is never widened in
place**"*).

**The `1e-9` carries nothing.** It is the one tolerance in the repo that never went through the
file's own tolerance protocol. So it was **measured** — frozen generators and bodies copied
byte-wise (R-D20-i), reporting the quantity the predicate bounds instead of asserting it
(`scratchpad/agent/Cl4Residue.hs`, throwaway per R-D21):

```
CL-4 RESIDUE  |lhs - rhs| / (1 + |rhs|)   over 200000 deterministic cases

CL-4 Saw (Properties.hs:85)    max residue = 2.7560e-15   bit-exact  54277/200000
                               frozen bound 1e-9   ==>  HEADROOM = 362,847 x
                               house standard 1e-12  ==>  WOULD PASS
CL-4 Is  (Properties.hs:107)   max residue = 1.6212e-15   bit-exact 112618/200000
                               frozen bound 1e-9   ==>  HEADROOM = 616,844 x
                               house standard 1e-12  ==>  WOULD PASS
```

**The float noise is 3e-15. The gate is set at 1e-9.** It is not absorbing noise. **It is a round
number.**

**And it is the gate on the law of §1b.** CL-4's own header, `Properties.hs:9-11`:

> *"Any Phase-2 conjugate fast path behind the opaque `Belief` handle is **legal iff this property
> still passes**: the fast path **buys speed, never semantics**."*

**CL-4 IS the optimisation law's enforcement mechanism** — the single gate standing between a fast
path and a semantic change. It is currently **~360,000× wider than the noise floor**: a "fast
path" wrong by `1e-10` — a hundred million ulps — would be **certified as semantics-preserving**.

**CL-4 must NOT become exact.** Its two sides are *deliberately different routes* (`lhs`
normalises once in log-space through `lse`; `rhs` divides two linear expectations, recovering the
likelihood by round-tripping `push` / `prob`). **That difference is the property's mechanism** —
make them cancel syntactically and CL-4 becomes a **tautology**. Unlike the float floor — where a
two-route residue became a **decision signal**, a real bug — **here the residue is noise, and
tolerating it is correct.** CL-4 needs a tolerance. It needs the **right** one.

> **REPAIR: `1e-9` → `1e-12`** — the house standard, at **363× measured headroom** (against the
> 8× the file's own other tolerance documents) — **plus the provenance paragraph the protocol
> demands.**

⚠️ **`test/Properties.hs` is FROZEN.** CLAUDE.md: *"If a frozen test IS wrong, stop and report;
the human re-opens Phase 1."* **This section is that report.** The repair may ride on this
boundary — which is already an author re-open — but it must be **named here and signed**, never
slipped in.

## 3. The derivation

### What IS an action

Each tick, some names are set by the world and read by the agent; some are set by the agent
and read by the world. That is the whole membrane. The design already dissolved every other
channel into this one — evidence is *"a role a name plays relative to a hypothesis, **not a
type**"*; prices are *"features, names like any other"*; *"the clock does not get a private
wire."* **Choice is the last private wire.**

> **An action is an assignment of values to the names the agent controls.**

Minimal and forced: you need the **names** (else you cannot learn from what you did, nor
price it) and the **grids** (else the action space is unpriceable). Nothing else. And an
assignment `[(Name, Double)]` **is** `Features`.

**The code already agrees.** `Slot` **is** `(Name, Grid)` (`Membrane.hs:138`) — verbatim,
the exact shape `enumerateModelsIn :: Namespace -> [(Name, Grid)] -> ...` takes. On the wire
`pSlot` and `pGuard` are **the same function**. `choiceJson` emits
`{"slots": {<name>: <value>}}` — literally `[(Name, Double)]`, the type of `Features`.
**The wire already transmits a written feature vector. It just labels it "slots".**

### What IS `wait` (A5)

Bayesian decision theory does not let you *choose* whether to update — coherence **forces**
conditioning on everything you know. **Inference is not an action.** Metareasoning exists
for exactly one reason: **inference consumes time, and while you compute, the world moves.**
Remove the clock and the question evaporates. So the decision is never *"should I think?"*
It is **"commit now, or not yet?"**

> **`wait` needs no construct whatsoever.** It is **every action name at the FIRST POINT of its
> grid** — see **§5c**, which supersedes the builder's first answer.

*(The first answer was "`wait` = the empty assignment", resting on the dormancy default —
absent names read `0.0`. The author rejected it: **"conventions scare me, we shouldn't use
conventions."** He was right, and §5c records why: dormancy exists for exactly one job, and
overloading it makes "unset" and "set to zero" indistinguishable. The replacement is
**structural, not conventional** — `mkGrid` takes a `NonEmpty`, so the first point **always
exists**, in every world, with no handshake.)*

Either way the load-bearing property is the same, and it is the one that matters:
**`argmax` stays total without a sentinel, because doing nothing is always in the menu.**

**The world sets the PRICE of waiting, never its availability** (brief §7: *"waiting has a
price the world sets, not the designer"*).

### No `last_action`. No lag. No window. (A4)

**`last_action` is a window of size one — and `window` is on CLAUDE.md's own
forbidden-token list.** Nothing justifies lag-1; a consequence can land five ticks later. A
hardcoded one-tick memory is a designer-chosen sufficient statistic: content injection
wearing a name.

Correct, with machinery that already exists: **the action is a feature of the tick in which
it is taken**, and arbitrary-lag dependence is carried by **latent state in hypotheses** —
the same `cond`-filtered latents that already do drift, change-points and walks.
`interface.md:118-124` already says a transition kernel is *"an expfam whose parameter
expression reads a **latent name** rather than a world feature"*; it need only also read an
**action** name. How far back the past matters is then **learned and priced**, never
declared.

Also kills `ticks_spent_thinking` (a designer-chosen sufficient statistic) and
`lastActionCode` — which is **lossy**: it discards every slot binding, so **no model today
could ever learn what a *parameterised* action does.**

### No `do()`? — ⚠️ **OPEN, NOT RULED** (A6; downgraded by RIDER 3, 2026-07-12)

**The builder recorded this as settled. The author has falsified that, and he is right.**

What the builder wrote: *"No intervention calculus, and none is needed. Scoring an action is
evaluating the predictive with that feature set to that value — plain `push`. Whether that has
causal force is itself a hypothesis; the posterior arbitrates."* And: *"if the agent always does A
when Z is high, 'A did it' and 'Z did it' are observationally identical. The only escape is to
vary the action independently — to explore — and exploration is an action with high VOI, which the
argmax selects exactly when the information is worth buying."* (brief §9: *"Thompson sampling,
ε-greedy, and UCB are permissible only if they **emerge** as expected-utility-optimal."*)

**Why that does not survive.** The author, verbatim:

> *"Push-at-assignment is **evidential** scoring: nothing stops the enumerator producing hypotheses
> with action–latent correlation (**it must**, to model the confound §3 honestly names), and then
> conditioning on a contemplated action updates latents **through the back-channel** —
> **smoking-lesion territory, where the agent manages the news rather than the world.** 'The
> posterior arbitrates, exploration escapes' is an **asymptotic** defence; **the transient can be
> dominated for as long as the confound persists.** Your own canon says manipulation-shaped
> problems need **path-specific objectives, not alphabet rules.**"*

**The error is exactly the one this whole document was written to diagnose, committed again.**
A6 is an **epistemic** axiom — *we cannot know that an action caused something*. The builder let
it license a **decision-theoretic** rule — *therefore score evidentially* — which it does not.
**That is the Savage move: a true theorem installed as a definition.** Twice in one repository,
by the same reflex.

**Status: OPEN.** A6 stands. "No `do()`" does not. **Falsifier owed before any ruling** (§9 OPEN 9):

> **a confounded-payoff world; measure whether and when exploration pressure rescues the choice.**

Not *whether it does asymptotically* — **when**, and **at what regret**, and whether the transient
is dominated. If evidential scoring loses money for as long as the confound persists, "the
posterior arbitrates" is a consolation, not a design.

### Heuristics are optimal actions (A7)

If computation were free the agent would always compute the exact posterior. It is not free.
So the EU-maximising move may be **run the cheap approximation and commit** — a heuristic is
not a degradation; under a dear clock it is *the Bayes-optimal act*.

- **The policy must therefore enter the action space** — brief §2's reflexive closure:
  *"a program can condition, predict, and optimise over the agent's own inference **as costed
  actions within itself**."*
- **WARNING: description length is NOT runtime.** Occam and the clock happen to point the
  same way, but a short program can be slow. **The cost of a computation must be MEASURED and
  published as a feature** — never inferred from bit-length, never declared as a constant.
  *This is exactly where a fabricated number would creep back in.*

## 4. EXECUTED — proofs, not proposals

All against the **shipped** engine. Throwaway prototypes (R-D21), discarded at freeze. A fourth —
`Cl4Residue.hs`, the 200,000-case measurement behind §2b — is reported there rather than here,
because it measures a **defect**, not a capability.

**(i) Value of information is a COMPOSITION.** `scratchpad/agent/VoiSentence.hs`.
`vThink` written as an **ordinary sentence** — `push`, `cond`, `argmax`, nothing else —
against the frozen `vThinkK` **primitive**:

```
rows: 45   max |sentence - primitive|: 2.220e-16   bit-exact: 21/45
```

⇒ `VThink`, `VThinkK`, `VPre`, `EU`, `VAct` and the whole `FN` sort are **deletable**.
The residual ulp is the two-derivations seam; **on deletion only one derivation remains, so
the seam ceases to exist.**

**(ii) The agent learns what its own actions do — with ZERO alphabet change.**
`scratchpad/agent/ActionModel.hs`. Over namespace `{t, action}` the *shipped* enumerator
produces 1241 models of which **72 are action models**. After 60 ticks of ordinary `cond`:

```
P(obs=1 | action=0) = 0.102941      P(obs=1 | action=1) = 0.897059
prior:                0.5                                 0.5
true world:           0.1                                 0.9
```

**(iii) THE LAZY-GENIUS TEST PASSES.** `scratchpad/agent/LazyGenius.hs`. Actions as
features; utility reads a **feature** (`payoff`); scoring is `E[ΔU]`; the world's opportunity
shrinks while you deliberate.

*(This prototype predates §5c and encodes `wait` as the empty assignment. **The result does not
depend on it**: what the test exercises is that doing nothing is **in the menu, scored by the same
argmax as everything else**, and §5c changes only how that option is spelled — from an absent name
to a first grid point. Re-running it under §5c is a step-5 oracle row, not a re-proof.)*

```

0.000   | 11             | commit-HIGH  | 1.0000
0.020   |  8             | commit-HIGH  | 0.8508

```

**A dearer clock buys MONOTONICALLY fewer deliberating ticks — never more** — and it still gets
the answer right every time. The **only** thing that varied is `hazard`, a *world feature*.

**"Strictly" was the builder's word and it is FALSE — RIDER 4's sibling, caught by the author
against this table.** At hazard **0.400 and 0.700 the count is the same: 1 tick.** The relation is
**monotone, not strict**, and the tie is printed here rather than hidden behind an adverb. *(The
one-tick floor is not a knob: it is where one more observation stops being worth its hazard, on an
integer tick grid.)*

Audited, literal by literal: the sole numbers on the decision path are the **dormancy zero**,
the **world's own decision boundary**, the **observation space**, and the **clock's terminal
zero**. **There is not one agent-side constant.** No price, no sentinel, no cap, no depth
knob. All ten forbidden semantic tokens absent from the code.

> brief §12: *"you must be **unable to identify the line of code** that made it lazy."*
> Today it is pointable: `membrane-wire.md:131`, and `Wire.hs:419` **mandates** it.
> **In the corrected ontology there is nothing to point at.**

⚠️ **RIDER 1 scopes what this test proves.** It passes **because `hazard` folds the future into the
present tick** — the world shrinks the stake *now*, so a one-step `E[ΔU]` sees the whole cost of
waiting. **It therefore does not exercise the myopia**, and must not be cited as evidence against
it. A payoff landing at `t+5` is invisible to this agent's choice. **§9 OPEN 8.**

## 5. The minimal type system — "minimal, but not less"

**Net: eleven types deleted, none added — the only new name is a SYNONYM.**

```haskell
-- SURVIVE untouched: the four nouns + evidence (brief §3 — always right)
Space, Belief, Event, Kernel, Evidence
Name, Grid                                  -- data with prices
type Features = [(Name, Double)]            -- THE one carrier.  Already exists.
Namespace                                   -- pricing

-- the ONLY new thing, and it is a SYNONYM, not a type:
type Menu = [(Name, Grid)]                  -- writable names + their grids
                                            -- (identical to enumerateModelsIn's extras)

-- an ACTION is a Features fragment: a partial assignment over the menu.
-- `wait` = every action name at the FIRST POINT of its grid (S5c).  NOT the
-- dormancy default -- grids are nonempty by CONSTRUCTION, so `wait` is
-- available STRUCTURALLY, in every world, with no convention and no handshake.
```

**DELETED — 11 types, ~12 functions.**
*The action apparatus (5):* `Choice`, `Affordance`, `AffId`, `Slot`, `InternalAct` — with
`internalMenu`, `lastActionCode`, `EchoSpec`, `echoFeatures`, `uDescribe`, `Rung`,
`PureWorld.wMenu`'s `[Affordance]`, `Pilot`'s `Choice` mentions, and the
`ticks_spent_thinking` counter.
*The value apparatus (2):* `Util` (§5's utility ruling), `Chan` (its recorded twin debt,
`Syntax.hs:325-341`).
*The likelihood apparatus (4):* `Carrier`, `Stats`, `Terminal`, `Model` — **all four are shapes
of a code** (§2a).

**DELETED from the alphabet** (each proven a composition or a shape ⇒ each was content, brief §12):
`EU`, `VAct`, `VThink`, `VThinkK`, `VPre`, **`Bern`** (§1b), `ExpFam` (→ `Code`), `SId` (→ `Pos`)
— **and with them the whole `FN`, `UTIL`, `STDNAME` and `STATS` sorts.** `IsEq` survives, folded
into `EXPR` beside `Gt`; `Call` has nothing left to call.

**ADDED to the alphabet** (each with its deletion proof):

| production | what is lost if removed |
|---|---|
| `Expect` **binds** its carrier variable, as `Argmax` already does | Without it **no `Argmax` can sit inside an expectation** — *precisely* why `VThink` had to be a primitive. |
| `SawE :: Eq b => Expr env (K a b) -> Expr env b -> Expr env (Ev a)` | Without it **no program can condition at all.** Today there is **no `Expr env (Ev a)` constructor whatsoever** — `CondE` is unreachable from any sentence. **This is the hole `VThink` papered over.** |
| `ElimJ` | Without it a conditioned belief cannot be **consumed** by a sentence. |
| **`Code`** (§2a; replaces `ExpFam` in the KER sort, 1 → 1) | Without it **no enumerated sentence can assign likelihood** — E9's proof, corrected in §5b and now *stronger*, because `Code` is the **sole** route where `rw` used to be a second one. |
| **`Pos`** (§5b) — the POSITION reader | Without it **`walkOn`'s adjacency is unsayable**: the shipped grids are FP-nonuniform, so adjacency is **not a function of the values**, and the boundary reflection *doubles* a neighbour's mass. |
| **`ToR`** (§5d) — the VALUE reader | Without it **`expfam`'s `η·T(y)` is unsayable**: `T(y)` must be a `Double`, and a *position* cannot supply it. **`ToR`, NOT `Pos`, is what subsumes `Stats`/`SId`.** |

**ARITHMETIC IS REQUIRED. (RE-CORRECTED 2026-07-12 — this reverses the builder's previous
correction, which was wrong.)**

The builder first called arithmetic blocking, then withdrew it on the grounds that a utility over
features is a **decision tree with grid-priced leaves** and that `E[ΔU]`'s subtraction cancels in
the argmax. **Both of those remain true, and they are beside the point.** Arithmetic is forced
not by *utility* but by **§2a — the likelihood.**

`Expr` has **no arithmetic at all** (`prodExpr = 10`: `MkC Get If Gt Var Push CondE Expect Argmax
Call`). A Double-valued sentence today can only be nested `If`/`Gt` over grid constants — it is
**piecewise constant**. It cannot express `−log₂ θ`, nor `η·T(y)/ln2`, nor `walkOn`'s `mass`.
**A code length is an arithmetic expression, and there is no way to say one.**

| forced | by |
|---|---|
| `Sub`, `Add` | `bernFast`'s `1 − θ`; `walkOn`'s three-term `mass`; `σ`'s `1 + exp _` |
| `Mul`, `Div` | `ExpFam`'s `η·T(y)/ln2`; `pApprove`'s `w · σ(u/τ)`; **and `logBase x y = log y / log x`** |
| **`Log`** | every `logBase 2` — bern, walkOn, verdict |
| **`Exp`** | **`verdictKernel`'s σ — and it calls `bernFast` at a COMPUTED, OFF-GRID θ, so no lookup table can stand in.** This is the one that admits no escape. |
| `Neg` | ubiquitous, and `0 − x` differs from `negate x` at `−0.0` |

**REFUTED en route — "grid the code lengths, so one constant suffices."** `fromBits`'s
normalisation is shift-invariant **in ℝ but not in IEEE-754**: measured against the shipped theta
grid, the one-constant form and `bernFast` are bit-identical for θ ∈ {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5} and
**differ for {0.4, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9}** — **5 of 9**. Gridding does **not** buy away the
arithmetic. The claim was true in ℝ and false in the machine.

**This is the largest blast radius in the re-derivation, and it was always going to be paid** —
because **the engine already computes every one of these in Haskell, behind the alphabet's back.**
The arithmetic is not being *added* to the language. It is being **confessed**.

**Utility**: an ordinary `Expr env Double` reading `Get`, and **latent** — a belief over
utility programs (brief §9, CIRL). `Util a y` dies. Repeals the spec's
*"utilities are featureless and clockless"* clause (cited here as
`typed-port-spec.md:172-177` when this plan was written; the text moved to
**`:220-225`** at the step-3 renumbering and was REPAIRED IN PLACE at the step-8
outcome freeze — the stale cite corrected under the frozen-layer inventory, the
step-8 sitting ruling that a stale line-cite in the author's own plan is incorrect
frozen text and the inventory covers plan cites), which is backwards: **utility must
read features, because features ARE the consequences.**

---

## 5b. The primitivity audit — brief §12, discharged for the first time

> *"The **grammar**: terminals, production rules, and — for **each** terminal — a one-line
> proof that its deletion costs a capability that would then need external supply.
> **Terminals without such a proof are cut.**"*

**The deletion audit covers 2 of ~22 productions.** Gate 7 (`audit/ablation.sh`) ablates
exactly **`push`** and **`argmax`**. **`condition` — one of the three verbs — has never been
ablated.** Nor have `Get`, `If`, `Gt`, `Var`, `MkC`, `Expect`, `Call`, `EU`, `IsEq`, `VAct`,
`VThink`, `VThinkK`. By the brief's own rule, every one of them is *"a standing bug against
the prior."*

And one is self-convicting — `Syntax.hs:299`, the author's own comment:
> `-- the derived name (EXPFAM_PLAN E6): bern re-derived over the expfam basis`

**`Bern` is recorded as DERIVED and sits in the priced alphabet charging bits.** brief §4's
forbidden move, written down and shipped.

### Truly primitive (each deletion costs a capability)

`Push`, `CondE`, `Argmax` (the three verbs) · `Expect` (the *prevision* — brief §3's atom) ·
`Get` (delete ⇒ the agent is blind) · `MkC` (delete ⇒ no threshold or grid point is sayable)
· `If` (brief §9: *"branching gives you closed-loop structure; that is all you need"*) ·
`Gt` (the only ordering predicate) · **`IsEq`** (**option dispatch** — used on the
argmax-bound option, `Acceptance.hs:205`; delete it and a policy cannot branch on *which act
it is scoring*, and it is **not** derivable from `Gt`, which is Double-only) · `Var` (forced
by the binders) · `SawE`, `ElimJ` (proofs above) · **`Code`** and **`Pos`** and the
**arithmetic** (below).

**`Code`** — the sole likelihood production (§2a):

```haskell
Code :: Space a -> Space b -> Expr (b ': a ': env) Double -> Expr env (Maybe (K a b))
--       domain    codomain   the CODE LENGTH of y (Var Z) given x (Var (S Z))
-- codomain AMENDED at code-freeze-r0 (R-C1 ruling iii, pack §6.10): a code with a
-- NaN/−∞ entry or a massless (all-+∞) column DOES NOT DENOTE — Nothing, eagerly, at
-- eval; every L in [0, +∞] denotes (the frozen ExpFam rows force the boundary).
-- eval:  validate the dom × cod grid; iff every column is lawful,
--        Just (kernel dom cod (\x -> fromBits cod (\y -> Bits (evalx body ...))))
--        Space payloads priced 0 — the opaque-payload convention ExpFam already uses
```

**`Pos`** — the POSITION reader:

```haskell
Pos :: Eq a => Space a -> Expr env a -> Expr env Double   -- position in the DECLARED space
```
`walkOn`'s adjacency. The shipped grids are **FP-nonuniform**
(`0.2 + 0.1 = 0.30000000000000004 ≠ 0.3`), so **adjacency is not a function of the values** — and
the boundary reflection *doubles* a neighbour's mass, which no value-difference predicate
reproduces. It needs `elemIndex`.

> ⚠️ **The first draft of this section claimed `Pos` ALSO "subsumes `Stats`/`SId`, so the whole
> STATS sort deletes." THAT IS FALSE. See §5d — it is `ToR` that does, and it is a SECOND
> production.**

**`ToR`** — the VALUE reader (§5d; OPEN 6 **ruled** at code-freeze-r0):

```haskell
ToR :: Expr env Obs -> Expr env Double    -- realToFrac: the carrier VALUE (SId's workload)
```
Entry added at code-freeze-r0 (the author's review, 2026-07-13): the §5d correction
declared the production but left it out of THIS audit — an alphabet member without a
deletion proof, against the law's own demand. The proof, one line: **value is not
derivable from index without a grid-indexing production, just as index is not derivable
from value on the FP-nonuniform grids** — neither reader constructs the other, and
`test-code` group 4 pins a carrier where they disagree, by construction. Delete `ToR`
and `eta * T(y)` is unsayable (§5d's defect returns as a capability loss).

### E9's deletion proof, CORRECTED

E9 claimed *"delete `expfam` and **nothing** can assign likelihood."* **That was already false.**
`Evidence.Is` and the exported `kernel` / `fromBits` are unfenced routes, and **`test/Properties.hs`
itself builds arbitrary code likelihoods with zero grammar involvement.** The deletion proof was a
**CPP fence, not a type.** Stated correctly it is **true, and now stronger**:

> **Delete `Code` ⇒ no enumerated sentence can assign likelihood** — and `Code` is the **sole**
> route, where `rw` used to be a second one.

### Cut (each a composition, or a shape ⇒ content ⇒ stealing bits from the prior)

`EU`, `VAct`, `VThink`, `VThinkK`, `VPre` (**proven**: 45 rows, 1 ulp) · **`Bern`** (§1b — the
law's one live violation) · `ExpFam`, `Stats`, `SId`, `Carrier`, `rw`/`THmm`/`MHmm`, `Terminal`,
`Model` (§2a — shapes of a code) · `FnInd`, `FnUtil` (subsumed by `Expect`-with-binder) · `USay`
(utility is an ordinary `Expr`).

### The result: FOUR WHOLE SORTS vanish — and the honest cost is +1.07 bits per node

**(Counts CORRECTED 2026-07-12 by §5d. The first draft said EXPR 20 / 21 productions / "exactly
+1.0 bit"; it had missed `ToR`.)**

| sort | today | after | |
|---|---|---|---|
| EXPR | 10 | **21** | 9 kept (`Call` drops) + `IsEq` + `SawE` + `ElimJ` + **`Pos`** + **`ToR`** + 7 arithmetic |
| KER | 1 | **1** | `ExpFam` → `Code` |
| FN | 2 | **—** | subsumed by `Expect`-with-binder |
| UTIL | 1 | **—** | utility is an ordinary `Expr` |
| STDNAME | 7 | **—** | every member proven a composition or a shape |
| STATS | 1 | **—** | subsumed by **`ToR`** (NOT by `Pos` — §5d) |
| **total** | **22 productions, 6 sorts** | **22 productions, 2 sorts** | |

**`prodExpr` 10 → 21 is `+1.07` bits per node** (`lg 21 − lg 10 = 4.3923 − 3.3219 = 1.0704`).
*The tidy "exactly +1.0" of the first draft was an artifact of the production I had missed — 20 =
2 × 10 was a coincidence of the error, and it is recorded here because a number that pretty is
exactly the kind that stops getting checked.*

**The production count does not fall (22 → 22). The SORT count collapses, 6 → 2.** That is the
honest headline: the win is **structural, not arithmetic** — four sorts of hand-carved vocabulary
replaced by one generative likelihood production and the arithmetic that was always being computed
behind the alphabet's back. **Every sentence gets ~1.07 bits dearer per node**, and **the prior is
where that belongs.**

Against it: every `Call` stops paying `stdB` (**lg 7 = 2.81 bits**), every `Expect` stops paying
the FN bit (**1.0**), and the VOI primitives stop being reachable at all. **Real sentences get
cheaper; vocabulary nobody earned stops being subsidised.** `prodTable` drops from six fields to
two, and **every price literal in nine test files reprices** — the P5 single-site alphabet
constant firing exactly as designed.

---

## 5d. STOP AND REPORT — `Pos` does NOT subsume `Stats`/`SId` (builder defect, caught by execution)

**A false claim in this document, found while executing step 1's oracle prototypes, one day after
the boundary was signed.** It is recorded here rather than quietly patched, because §0's entire
lesson is that this project's failures are the ones nobody wrote down.

**The claim (§5b, first draft):** *"`Pos` … the carrier → Double reader — which **subsumes
`Stats`/`SId`**, so the whole STATS sort deletes."*

**The refutation, `src/PropLang/Eval.hs:165-168`, verbatim:**

```haskell
statVal :: Stats c -> c -> Double
statVal s = case s of
  SId -> realToFrac
```

**`SId` reads the carrier's VALUE. `Pos` reads its POSITION. They are different functions.** They
agree on every carrier shipped today for exactly one reason —

```haskell
obsCarrier = mkCarrier "obs" (0 :| [1])          -- Enumerate.hs:317
```

— **value ≡ index, by coincidence.** And this document's **own OPEN 6** says so: *"That is a
coincidence of the declarations, **not a theorem** — `mkCarrier "c" (2 :| [5])` separates them
instantly."* **§5b then leaned on the coincidence anyway, two sections earlier. Both were written
by the builder, on the same day.** The register caught what the argument did not.

`expfam`'s `η · T(y)` needs `T(y) :: Double`. **A position cannot supply it.** So a **second
reader is forced**:

```haskell
ToR :: Real c => Expr env c -> Expr env Double     -- the VALUE reader (realToFrac)
Pos :: Eq a => Space a -> Expr env a -> Expr env Double   -- the POSITION reader (elemIndex)
```

**Neither subsumes the other, and both are forced.** They answer different questions: *where is
this point in its space?* (adjacency — `walkOn`) versus *what is this point's value?* (a statistic
— `expfam`). **Conflating them is what produced the error.**

### The alternative, executed and REJECTED on evidence

The obvious escape is to make carriers `Space Double`, so `Var Z` is already a `Double` and **no
coercion production exists to write** — which would keep EXPR at 20 and the tidy `+1.0`. Under
A3/A4 (*"all we get are features"*, and a feature is `(Name, Double)`) that is arguably the
*ontologically* right move, and it was tempting.

**It was measured, not argued.** One line — `type Obs = Int` → `type Obs = Double`
(`Enumerate.hs:304`) — plus two `src/` signature generalisations (`bernFast`, `Bern`, both
hardcoded to `Int`), and:

| | result |
|---|---|
| **gate 1** (`-Wall -Werror -Wincomplete-patterns -Wincomplete-uni-patterns`) on `src/` | ✅ **clean** |
| `test/Properties.hs` | ✅ **3/3 pass, unmodified** |
| **`test-hygiene/Hygiene.hs:143`** | ❌ **HARD BREAK.** `constStake = mkUtil (\() y -> fromIntegral (y :: Obs))` — **requires `Integral Obs`, and `Double` is not `Integral`.** |
| **`test/Acceptance.hs:112, :243`** | ❌ **BREAK.** `[Int]` streams where `[Obs]` is expected. |

**Both broken suites are ones §8 declares SURVIVORS** — *"inference was always right"*. **The
Double-carrier route would re-open `test/Acceptance.hs` — the Phase-1 oracle itself — to buy a
cosmetic production count.** It is rejected. **`ToR` lands.**

### The pins, executed (R-D21 satisfiability transcript for step 1)

All three step-1 rows are **satisfiable and BIT-EXACT against the frozen engine**, against
throwaway prototypes now discarded:

| pin | vs the frozen artifact | result |
|---|---|---|
| **`rw` — THE FALSIFIER** (*"if a code cannot express the reflected walk, stop and report"*) | `walkOn`, 7 values of ρ × 81 cells | **567/567 BIT-EXACT** |
| **`bern`** | the shipped `emit` kernel | **9/9 BIT-EXACT** |
| **`expfam`** (with `ToR`) | `ExpFam` eval at η = logit θ | **9/9 BIT-EXACT** |
| the walk's **hard zero** | non-neighbour cell | `L = Infinity` bits ⇒ weight **exactly 0** |
| `logBase 2 y` vs `Log y / Log 2` | GHC.Float's own definition | **9/9 BIT-EXACT** ⇒ **the grammar needs no `logBase`** |

> **THE STEP-1 FALSIFIER DOES NOT FIRE. The reflected walk IS a code, bit for bit. T1 is dissolved
> by execution, not by argument** — and codifying `walkOn` is confirmed to be **a rename, not a
> re-derivation.**

**Custody (R-D22):** this section is a **delegated freeze-edit** to a document already under the
author's signed tag (`agent-boundary`, `f46e08c`). **R-D22 therefore obliges an author RE-TAG
within the increment: the countersignature is a condition of closure, never a courtesy
afterwards.** The builder has committed it with the builder key and made **no tag.**
**DISCHARGED: `agent-boundary-r1` is that re-tag** (recorded stale by the 2026-07-14
review, S2; amended at the design-review gate).

---

## 5c. `wait` without a convention (corrected 2026-07-12)

The builder first built `wait` on the **dormancy** default (*absent names read 0.0*). That
was an **overload**: dormancy exists for exactly one job (brief §9 — a sentence about a
sensor that does not exist **yet** is inert until it appears), and pressing it into service
as *"I did not act"* makes "unset" and "set to zero" indistinguishable. **Conventions are
what this whole re-derivation is deleting.**

> **`wait` = every action name at the FIRST point of its grid**, and the world declares what
> that value is.

`mkGrid :: Name -> NonEmpty Double -> Grid` — *"Grids are nonempty by construction"*
(`Syntax.hs:81`). So the first point **always exists**: `wait` is available **structurally,
in every world, with zero new machinery and no handshake.** It is also *more honest* — it
forces a world to **say what inaction looks like on its own lever**, which is information
the agent needs anyway. And CL-3's first-listed-wins then hands ties to it automatically:
**the safe default falls out of a rule we already have.**

Dormancy goes back to doing only its one job.

---

## 6. Pricing: the action space enters the prior, for the first time

One namespace. A writable name is mentioned at `log₂|ns|` like any name; a value is drawn
from its grid at `log₂|grid|` like any constant. **M5 is repealed** — it carved the action
vocabulary out of a law whose own rationale covers it (*"a richer world makes every sentence
about it more surprising. **This is a semantic commitment**"*), to protect a "fourth flow"
that is nowhere derived. Publishing an affordance now **costs the prior something**.
**brief §5 is satisfied on the action side for the first time.**

### ⚠️ RIDER 2 — the repeal opens a coherence hole, and M5 was clumsily guarding it

The author, verbatim:

> *"Mention price is log₂|ns|, and the world grows the namespace at runtime by publishing
> affordances. If sentence prices are fixed at enumeration time, **two identical sentences
> enumerated either side of a publication carry different priors — path dependence**, and your own
> tripwire property should red on it… implementers will freeze enumeration-time prices and **ship
> the incoherence M5 was clumsily guarding against.**"*

**He is right, and the plan as written did not pin it.** M5 was the wrong answer to a real
question. Repealing it without answering that question ships the bug M5 was blocking.

### The pin (his own doctrine, and the wire already has the shape)

> *"treat writable names exactly like appearing sensors — the ideal prior is over the **completed
> namespace**, owned posterior **odds** are invariant under mid-episode publication, new sentences
> price at the enlarged alphabet."*

**This is the DORMANCY doctrine applied to actions** — brief §9's *sentence about a sensor that
does not exist yet is inert until it appears*, verbatim. And the wire is **already shaped for it**:
the v1/v2 hello carries the namespace and the menu **side by side** —

```json
{"world":{"namespace":["t","x"],"guards":[…],"menu":[…]}}      -- test-d/D.hs:1000-1008
```

so the fix costs one sentence of protocol, and it makes odds byte-stable **by construction rather
than by luck**:

> **NAMESPACE MEMBERSHIP IS DECLARED AT HANDSHAKE AND IS IMMUTABLE. Publication toggles
> AVAILABILITY, not membership.**

Prices are then over the completed namespace **from tick zero**, so **nothing ever re-prices**, so
owned posterior odds cannot move. *(Note why the naive reading fails and this one does not: if
`|ns|` grew mid-episode, two carried sentences with **different mention-counts** would take
**different** dl increments — so their odds WOULD shift. Invariance is not automatic; it is bought
by making the namespace immutable.)*

**WIRE CONSEQUENCE, which must be stated and is a `membrane-wire.md` change:** the hello's
`namespace` **must include every writable name, including those not yet in the menu.** A world may
not conjure a name mid-episode.

**FIXTURE (the author's, owed at step 7):** *publish an affordance mid-episode; **existing
posterior odds byte-stable**.*

## 7. Build order

Oracle-first per CLAUDE.md; the builder never owns a live oracle.

**Progress register (S4, added 2026-07-15):**
step 0 ✅ (`agent-boundary` `f46e08c` + `agent-boundary-r1`) ·
step 1 ✅ (`code-freeze-r0` `1027398` + `code-freeze-r1` `ea891f0`; as-built record
`code-task2-author-pack.md` §7) ·
step 2 ✅ (`optlaw-freeze-r0` `66a48f1`, signed and verified 2026-07-15 — the single-tag
close, oracle and gates green on the same signature; as-built record
`optlaw-author-pack.md` §8–9; manifest 85 rows; the R-D22 riders for `5fa305d` and
`0b20495` DISCHARGED by this tag) · steps 3–10 open.

0. **This document, signed.** (Author.) **Nothing frozen moves until the tag exists.**
1. **`Code` + `Pos` + arithmetic** (§2a, §5). Oracle: pin the code forms of `bern`, `expfam`
   and `rw` against the engine's own `bernFast` / `ExpFam` / `walkOn`. **`rw` is the
   falsifier** — if a code cannot express the reflected walk, **stop and report.** (It can:
   it already *is* one.) Guard `fromBits` against `NaN` / `−∞` (§9 OPEN 4).
2. **The optimisation law, enforced** (§1b). **Scope PINNED (ruled 2026-07-15, decision 3):**
   the §1b audit table's three rows — `bernFast` (already pinned by E7), **CL-4 tightened
   to `1e-12`** (§2b; the frozen `test/Properties.hs` repair is an author re-open, named
   and signed at this boundary), and **`observeCounts` pinned to repeated `observe`** —
   plus the law's text into frozen `CLAUDE.md` (one author edit, carrying the R-D21
   canonization in its ruled mechanical form and the evidence-program-before-ruling
   protocol line — decisions 4 and 6; drafts in `AGENT_PLAN_REVIEW.md` Appendix A), plus
   **a one-time completeness sweep of the r1 tree for unpinned fast paths**, recorded in
   the step-2 pack. If the sweep finds nothing, the table freezes as exhaustive-at-r1;
   thereafter "the rule" means every future fast path arrives with its pin in-increment
   (the CLAUDE.md clause), never by appending to step 2.
   **Tolerance pre-emption (the author, decision 3): measure the `observeCounts`
   batch-vs-sequential residue over the frozen worlds BEFORE choosing bit-exact or
   toleranced — the pin must not be born with a round number; that is how the `1e-9`
   happened.** Nothing else enters this step.
3. **A hypothesis becomes a sentence.** `Model` → `Expr env (K a Obs)`; `Terminal` → the
   fragment's production table. Delete `Bern`, `THmm`, `Model`, `Terminal`.
   **Obligation rows, queued at code-freeze-r0 (the author's review, 2026-07-13).** The
   per-tick refutation ruling (pack §6.10 item 4) binds this step's integration with one
   clause of precision: **a hypothesis is refuted only at ticks where its code's
   observation channel actually carried an observation — silence never refutes.**
   "Asserted the impossible THERE" presupposes a there; construction-time validation on a
   silent tick must not kill hypotheses about intermittent sensors for failing to predict
   an event that never occurred. Two falsifier rows for this step's oracle: (a) a code
   ill-formed at t=0 and lawful at t≥1 is dead from tick 0 onward — the eval half is
   already pinned (`test-code` group 7); (b) a code whose channel is SILENT at t survives
   t regardless of denotation there. And the consonance worth recording (the author, same
   review): `test-code`'s transcript row 5 makes a CERTAINTY KERNEL sayable (hard zeros
   elsewhere, a P = 1 survivor) where the old lattice made certain *parameters* unsayable
   — no conflict: **Cromwell lives in the mixture, not the member**; a dogmatic hypothesis
   is one contrary observation from a permanent zero, which is exactly ruling 4's
   semantics applied to itself.
   **Two rows added at the design-review gate (2026-07-15, decisions 8–9):** the model
   fragment's production table is DECLARED through `bitsAt` from day one — no interim
   hand-counted bits (step 4's own complaint, pre-empted); and this step's oracle
   directory carries **increment-local ablation fixtures for `Code`/`Pos`/`ToR`** (the
   CPP hooks are already wired, `Syntax.hs:38-44`; only fixtures are missing — the
   cheapest audit coverage this project will ever buy). From this step onward every NEW
   production lands with its in-increment ablation, per the CLAUDE.md increment
   protocol's fixture clause.
   **The optimisation law's first scheduled application (pre-registered at the step-2
   freeze — the author's rider, 2026-07-15, quoted):** *"step 3's enumeration filter —
   legalised as an optimisation by step-1 ruling 4 on a measured equivalence in a
   discarded scratch — becomes a live fast path the moment it is implemented, and under
   the clause you are about to freeze it must arrive with its pin in the same
   increment."* The filter's pin is therefore an opening-checklist item of this step's
   oracle, scheduled rather than remembered.
4. **One pricing mechanism, two declared tables.** R4's derivation-relative dl **stands and is
   correct** (`GRAMMAR_HYGIENE_PLAN.md:168`; the builder's "two priors" claim was wrong) — but
   its literals (`dlConst = 1 + mention eg`, …) are `bitsAt` **with a hand-rolled table**. One
   mechanism, two **declared** production tables (policy fragment, model fragment). **No
   hand-counted bits.**
5. **Actions become features.** `Menu = [(Name, Grid)]`; `wait` = the first grid point (§5c);
   delete the five types, the echo path, and **the sentinel**.
6. **Actions in the feature stream, no lag.** Latent-carrying hypotheses do the memory.
   **OPENING-CHECKLIST ROW, scheduled at the step-5 freeze (ruling D-a6): the g4Self
   self-signature deliverable RETURNS here** — it retired-until-6 at step 5 (the echo that
   carried actions died; a port then would have pinned vacuous behavior), and this row is
   its scheduled resurrection: the C-world re-declared with its action in the feature
   stream, the competitor control intact (retire-until-N is a named disposition; a deferred
   obligation living only in a retired file's comment is the R6 disease wearing a new hat).
   The scoring RULE is OPEN (RIDER 3), and **6b runs INSIDE this step's oracle phase**
   (re-sequenced 2026-07-15, decision 6): whichever scoring rule survives the falsifier
   is what the step-6 oracle pins — the freeze never encodes a rule its own falsifier
   convicts.
   *(Proof (ii) stands: it shows the agent LEARNS its action's effect. It does not show the
   evidential scoring rule is correct — RIDER 3.)*
   **RIDER 2's membership declaration BINDS HERE (ruled 2026-07-15, decision 7):** the
   hello's namespace includes every writable name from this step's freeze onward, so
   mention prices are over the completed namespace from the first increment that can
   utter them. **Obligation: this step's oracle contains NO assignment-priced row —
   mention prices bind at 6, value prices at 7 — else the pins pay R-C4's
   double-repricing a second time.**
   **RESOLVED AT THE STEP-6 SITTING (2026-07-16; pack Part V §32): THE SCORING RULE IS
   EXOGENOUS-READ.** 6b ran oracle-phase (criteria committed FIRST at b721bb2; the r1
   label-invariant indicator amended alone at 16de2c0 before the re-run): N3 did NOT
   fire — evidential was not dominated at the pre-stated bar but went 0-for-200 seeds
   with no rescue ever (smoke plateaus 0.88 vs the 0.95 leg; median regret 89 vs 0.0),
   while exogenous-read took zero regret 200/200. The ruled resolution carries two
   clauses: SCOPE (what is convicted is THIS evidential rule — naive joint-conditioning
   through a phase-blind action channel — in this world class; outcome (c) stays an open
   alphabet question, guarded by the primitivity two-sided entry gate) and STRUCTURE
   (exogenous-read is functionally an intervention semantics at decision time, the
   contemplated action's incoming arrows severed, with NO do-operator in the language —
   A6 stands epistemic, decision-time reads are exogenous; both halves measured policy).
   **The g4Self opening-checklist row above is DISCHARGED here** (test-stream g3: the
   C-world re-declared with its action in the stream, competitor control intact,
   family-majority form with MECHANICAL membership — structure predicate, no hand list).
6b. **RIDER 3's falsifier — step 6's oracle-phase evidence program** (the step-1 §6
   E-program pattern: executed on throwaway prototypes, R-D21, before any ruling). **A
   confounded-payoff world; measure whether AND WHEN exploration pressure rescues the
   choice** — and at what regret. If evidential scoring is dominated for as long as the
   confound persists, *"the posterior arbitrates"* is a consolation, not a design. **Stop
   and report if it is.** **Rider (the author, decision 6): the success criteria are
   PRE-STATED NUMERICALLY — what counts as dominated, and over what horizon exploration
   must rescue the choice — before the world runs; no adjudication by eyeball.**
   **EXECUTED (2026-07-16), exactly as re-sequenced: both transcripts to the sitting,
   the stop-and-report arm did not fire; the resolution mark lives in step 6 above.**
7. **Pricing unified.** **M5 repealed**; the action space's VALUES enter the prior (a value
   drawn from its grid at `log₂|grid|`); the wire sentence lands (**`membrane-wire.md` gains
   the requirement that the hello's `namespace` include writable names not yet in the
   menu**). **RIDER 2's pin — namespace membership is declared at handshake and IMMUTABLE
   (publication toggles availability, not membership) — BINDS FROM STEP 6** (ruled
   2026-07-15, decision 7: mention prices at 6, value prices here).
   **Fixture: publish an affordance mid-episode; existing posterior odds byte-stable.**
   *(The fixture stays at this step: before step 6 no hypothesis mentions a writable name,
   so the mid-episode-publication fixture is vacuous earlier.)*
   **Three opening-checklist rows added at the step-6 sitting (2026-07-16):**
   (i) **THE EXECUTABLE DUTCH-BOOK CHECK lands HERE** (re-homed from the step-9/10
   suite by the author's ruling: its subject is D8's predictive coherence under
   refusers plus pricing — frozen since step 3 and this step's own topic, untouched by
   the step-9 demolition; an executed row over random refuser patterns, never haddock
   prose). (ii) **THE PILOT SPLIT, part (ii) — RE-HOMED TO STEP 8 (ruling D-c5, RULED at the
   step-7 sitting 2026-07-17; a re-home with a cost argument, not a reversal)**: the census
   found the move is NOT free here (constructors cannot leave their type's module;
   THREE frozen oracles construct PilotIdle/PilotThreshold via import PropLang.Membrane
   — test-actions:144-155, test-membrane:240-341, test-stream:111), and the honest
   designs (runMembrane generalised over the decision procedure, or a harness-side
   second loop pinned extensionally) each carry their own new ruling. Step 8 re-opens
   this exact terrain regardless (Util dies, interpretPilot's arms are rewritten for
   utility-on-outcomes, the acceptance-lineage row re-opens test-membrane and likely
   test-actions/test-stream whose worlds carry utility tables) — the split folds into
   re-opens already owed, at the boundary where the Pilot type is being redesigned
   anyway. The step-6 ground ("the first boundary that can fix it for free") is
   honoured: 7 is not that boundary and 8 nearly is. The src fence comments hold the
   line for one more step. (iii) **D-b2's
   DISJOINTNESS SENTENCE joins this step's wire touch**: the tick's features and the
   chosen assignment's names are disjoint by handshake — the stream is the world's
   document, one authority, no merge semantics (world-first; the stuck-lever ground:
   intend a=1, actuator jams, world publishes 0, hypotheses learn what HAPPENED).
8. **Utility on world states, latent.** `Util a y` dies; utility becomes a priced `Expr` over
   features, and a belief over utility programs (CIRL).
   **RULED AND EXECUTED AT THE STEP-8 SITTING (2026-07-17; outcome-author-pack.md
   Parts I-VIII).** THE DOCTRINE, as the sitting framed it: **no OUTCOME sort exists
   because none is owed** — features are the world state as rendered, the act is among
   them since step 6, and minimality held at the ontology level without anyone defending
   it. The replacement surface (D-e1): `newtype USent = USent (Expr '[Double, Double]
   Double)` — the priced program that was always inside `USay`; the host-function
   wrapper dies; the ONE bridge `uAt :: Features -> USent -> Double -> Double -> Double`
   passes the tick's features (E-d1 measured the entire semantic change to be that one
   argument). **THE RESIDUE NAMED** (the sitting's footnote, the typing audit's own):
   the surviving two-variable scope is the not-yet-featurized residue of Savage's
   (act, outcome) pair — retained for continuity through the demolition, its A1-terminal
   form recorded beside it (utility as `Get`-only over the completed feature row,
   reachable when worlds publish outcomes as features); **the residue dies knowingly at
   a named boundary, never as a lingering default.** The wire's `said@1` (D-e5): the
   principal's declaration as a POINT-MASS PRIOR over the program shape with the
   grid-priced parameter latent — fail-closed. Chan survives with its debt RE-DATED to
   step 9 (D-e6). **8b RULED (ii): THE MYOPIA PRINTS AS THE SCOPE LIMIT** — see 8b.
   **OPENING-CHECKLIST ROW (ordered at the step-6 sitting): the amendment schedule
   names every acceptance-lineage row whose green currently re-confirms the OLD
   ontology R(a,s) = u(a(s))** (the test-sentence g1 ports; the test-membrane t1
   utility rows) **and re-derives or retires each at this boundary** — the founding
   oracle deliberately pins both ontologies at once until this step fires; every
   acceptance run until then re-confirms the calculator's definition (pack §29a).
   **OPENING-CHECKLIST ROW (re-homed from step 7 at the step-7 sitting, D-c5): THE
   PILOT SPLIT, part (ii)** — the scripted competitor arms leave src inside this
   step's Pilot redesign (interpretPilot's arms are rewritten for utility-on-outcomes
   here; the frozen-import re-opens this row needs are already owed to the
   acceptance-lineage row above). The forgetter asymmetry dies HERE.
   **AND: the wire's assign@1 utility block dies here with Util** (the step-7 sitting,
   D-c7 rider 1: assign@1 entered the wire as INTERIM with its death date printed —
   this row is that death; the step-8 wire touch replaces it with the
   utility-on-outcomes form).
   **Two scoping carries, ordered at the step-7 r1 sitting (2026-07-17):**
   (i) **OPEN WITH THE MEASUREMENT, NOT THE DESIGN** — expect an E-c1-style discovery:
   the assign@1 interim, the utilTie/constU worlds, and the g2-bridged EU fold mean
   some of utility's machinery already routes through public verbs; measure what
   already ships before assuming arithmetic is owed ("the repeal is a description" was
   the cheapest ruling this project ever made, and there may be another one waiting).
   (ii) **THIS STEP IS THE TYPING AUDIT'S PROVING GROUND** — the original calculator
   hid in a utility type (u(act, state), the 86-commit defect), and this is where
   utility types are re-derived from the axioms: EVERY type this step lands arrives
   with its derivation line already written (the §8c rule binds forward from the
   step-6 freeze; this is the precise terrain where a quiet type once cost the
   project its agenthood, and where the audit proves it would have prevented it).
8b. **RIDER 1's falsifier and scope line — step 8's oracle-phase evidence program**
   (re-sequenced 2026-07-15, decision 6: the falsifier runs pre-freeze on a prototype, so
   step 8's oracle already encodes the ruled outcome instead of amending it afterwards).
   **A payoff-at-t+5 world where one-step `E[ΔU]` provably selects the dominated act.**
   Then EITHER a kernel-composition / recursion production lands **with its deletion
   proof**, OR **the myopia is printed as a scope limit** (§9 OPEN 8).
   **Rider (the author, decision 6): the kernel-composition arm is PRICED in the
   prototype, not merely demonstrated — `prodExpr` moves again, P5 fires again — so the
   ruling sees the bit cost beside the capability.**
   **A horizon CONSTANT is forbidden — it is the sentinel's disease returning.**
   **8b runs UNDER THE PRIMITIVITY GATE (canonized at the step-6 boundary): the
   payoff-at-t+5 falsifier IS the composition attempt — the production lands only on
   the sentence form's demonstrated failure, with its price beside it.**
   **EXECUTED AND RULED (ii) AT THE STEP-8 SITTING (2026-07-17): THE MYOPIA IS THE
   SCOPE LIMIT.** The falsifier ran with criteria committed first (e37c0ba): the
   visible-fuse world (a consequence at t+5 published as an ordinary sensor —
   visible to learning, invisible to myopic choice). **N1 held at the maximum** — the
   shipped rule refuses EVERY opportunity tick (refusal 1.000; mean utility 36.4 vs the
   oracle's 136.1; ~100 utility/run regret), structurally: acting costs now and the
   current tick's odds ignore the current act. **The composition attempt was EXECUTED
   and FAILED at the type level, in the compiler's words** (pack §9 — the gate's clause
   (a) discharged): five `Push`es nest and `K Features Features` is even constructible,
   but the transition body is inexpressible — `Gt` refuses a Features variable, no
   projection form exists, and `IsEq` between the bound points is the grammar's only
   Features predicate. **N3 held at the maximum** — granted the transition, the
   rollforward matches the oracle exactly; the LEARNED odds suffice. **THE RULING (ii),
   with the sitting's grounds:** the capability is not one production but a complex (the
   body's eliminators AND a transition-hypothesis family the falsifier granted rather
   than scoped); a depth-5 sentence landed now would be **a constant through the back
   door — "why five? because the fixture's fuse is five; fitting the alphabet to the
   falsifier's world is the sentinel's disease in its most polite dress"**; and the
   horizon is **reflexive-cost terrain** — rolling the model forward k steps is
   deliberation whose depth must be EARNED through the same value-of-computation
   machinery as everything else ("depth earned, not toggled"). **The lawful landing is
   depth-as-priced-choice at step 10, the boundary that owns reflexive cost**, with §9's
   compile witnesses and §12's numbers banked as its opening case file. TWO ORDERS,
   discharged at this freeze: the scope line prints BOTH gaps (choice-side eliminators
   AND model-side transition family) so the future boundary sees the full bill; and the
   visible-fuse world entered `test-outcome` as a **GREEN DECLARED-LIMITATION PIN**
   (R-D23 form) — the refusal ASSERTED as the known behaviour, flipped deliberately by
   whichever boundary lands the horizon, never silently.
9. **`Expect`-binder, `SawE`, `ElimJ`; delete the VOI primitives and the FN/UTIL sorts.**
   **TWO OPENING-CHECKLIST ROWS ordered at the step-8 r1 sitting (2026-07-17; the two
   instruments the step-8 miss bought, ruled distinct so neither is dropped as subsumed
   by the other — TWO FAILURE CLASSES):**
   (v) **THE CLAUDE.md TOUCH LANDS THE FULL-CORPUS OVERLAY BUILD as a lint row** (the
   MECHANICAL wave): when an increment declares an overlay, `tools/prefreeze-lint.sh`
   derives the corpus BY GLOB (every `test*/**/*.hs` — suites, fixtures, ablation
   fixtures) and BUILDS AND RUNS every member against it; any member that does not
   compile fails the lint. Provenance: the step-8 freeze sealed a batch that could not
   go green because the census enumerated seven suites and the wave had twelve members;
   all five misses would have failed this row instantly. *"The enumeration is what the
   census can get wrong; the corpus is what the build cannot."* (And the naive form —
   "run cabal test before freezing" — proves NOTHING at a replacement-surface seal,
   where the corpus is red BY DESIGN until implementation: the author's own remedy,
   sharpened at the sitting into the form that would have fired.)
   (vi) **THE WAVE CENSUS'S PERMANENT SECOND COLUMN: THE RULINGS-SWEEP** (the SEMANTIC
   wave, which the build CANNOT see): every wave census asks not only "what does the
   dying type break?" but **"what does each RULING falsify?"** — because a ruling can
   falsify a row that keeps compiling and keeps passing. **A suite pinning behaviour
   whose subject a ruling killed goes STALE GREEN, and no build detects it.**
   Provenance: test-unify constructed no `Util` at all and was invisible to a
   type-shaped sweep — it died by D-e5's ruling killing `assign@1` on the wire. Two
   instruments, two failure classes, both bought at the usual price.
   *(Proof (i).)* **Re-run the deletion audit against the smaller alphabet — with a proof for
   EVERY terminal** (today: 2 of ~22). **And the TYPE-derivation audit (§8) — its complement**
   (the retrospective pass; the step-6 first-pass table, pack §28 as adopted at the
   sitting, is its baseline).
   **Three opening-checklist rows added at the step-6 sitting (2026-07-16):**
   (i) **IsEq's primitivity gets the two-sided gate RETROSPECTIVELY** — the one
   surviving production whose primitivity is an assertion, made pre-arithmetic. The
   composition attempt: an equality test written as per-name difference arithmetic
   (Sub/Mul, Gt both ways) over the declared name set, options being Features over a
   declared menu. Either the attempt FAILS pinned (a ToR-style disagreement case, by
   construction) and IsEq keeps its codeword with a real proof, or it succeeds and
   IsEq is deleted at this step with the others — no third option (the ruling).
   (ii) **THE EU LAW-GRADE PROPERTY SUITE homes here**: VoI non-negativity (over the
   surviving Expect-composition — pinning a verb the same increment deletes would be a
   pin written to die), plus utility affine-invariance and generative argmax-optimality
   re-stated law-grade over the final decision surface (step 6's g6 rows stand as the
   early partial enforcement; the executable Dutch-book check landed at step 7 by the
   same amendment-schedule logic).
   (iii) **THE DELETION AUDIT'S WORLD COLUMN IS STANDING: every deletion-proof world
   is labeled GENERIC or SELF-LICENSED, and a terminal's survival cannot be earned
   exclusively on SELF-LICENSED worlds** (the A2-K obligation re-homed at last, as a
   field instead of a boundary's scope note — the only form that cannot be orphaned
   again; pack §29b).
   **(iv) OPENING-CHECKLIST ROW (ordered at the step-7 sitting): the NULL-EVENT
   PREDICTIVE QUERY (all sentences refusing at the queried features) is ruled HERE,
   WITH ElimJ's Nothing branch — one ruling, both faces** (conditioning on a null
   event is ElimJ's totality question wearing wire clothing; test-unify's Dutch-book
   row scopes itself to >= 1 denoting sentence and this row closes the excluded case
   so the two cannot be settled inconsistently).
10. **Reflexive closure (A7).** The policy enters the action space; computation cost is a
    **measured** feature; heuristics emerge. *brief §2's headline. Steps 1-9 stand without it.*
    **OPENING-CHECKLIST ROW (ordered at the step-8 sitting, ruling D-e7): THE HORIZON
    LANDS HERE, OR NOWHERE — depth-as-priced-choice.** Step 8 printed the
    recurring-stakes myopia as its scope limit and named this boundary its heir: rolling
    a model forward k steps is DELIBERATION, and its depth must be earned through the
    same value-of-computation machinery as every other act (never a constant — "why
    five?" is the sentinel's disease in its politest dress). The opening case file is
    banked: outcome-author-pack §9 (the compile witnesses — the two gaps: the body's
    Features eliminators, and the absent transition-hypothesis family) and §12 (the
    numbers — refusal 1.000, ~100 utility/run regret, the granted-transition rollforward
    at oracle parity, the price 0.0740 bits/node). `test-outcome`'s g3 is the
    declared-limitation pin this step flips — deliberately, never silently.
    **OPENING-CHECKLIST ROW (deferred at the step-6 r2, the author's direction: finish
    the language first — no premature optimisation): the `PilotEU` selection fold's
    §1b classification RETURNS HERE.** At reflexive closure, determine whether the
    step-6 selector (per-candidate EU at exogenous `predictive (feats ++ a)`) becomes
    sayable in-language, and close the §1b register row's verdict accordingly —
    sayable => true fast path, g2 (frozen since stream-freeze-r0) already the pin it
    must arrive with; not sayable => membrane-side general route, printed permanent
    (retire-until-N: scheduled, never remembered).

The sentinel and the `price` parameter are never "deleted" — after step 8 there is
**nowhere left to write them.**

---

## 8. Frozen corpus

**SURVIVE — AMENDED at code-freeze-r0 (R-C3, the author's ruling: never keep incorrect
information in a frozen boundary; delegation recorded in the freeze commit).** The original
line here — *"SURVIVE — inference was always right: `hygiene`, acceptance test 1,
`test/Acceptance.hs` entirely"* — was **measured and is false for all three**
(pack §4 R-C3): `test/Acceptance.hs` uses `Util` (×5), `EU`/`VAct`/… (×4), `Terminal`;
`test-hygiene/Hygiene.hs` uses `FnInd` (×21) and the alphabet-constant pins (×6);
`test-expfam/ExpFam.hs` uses `ExpFam`/`SId`/`Carrier` (×40). **The only genuine survivor
of the whole re-derivation is `test/Properties.hs`** — the file carrying the `1e-9`
defect (§2b). The ruled disposition for everything else: **PORT the anchors — they ARE
the proof.**

**RE-OPENED, minimally and by name** (each is a *frozen text is wrong* report, not a convenience):

| file | change | why |
|---|---|---|
| `test/Properties.hs` | **`1e-9` → `1e-12`** + the provenance paragraph | **§2b.** Measured: float noise is 3e-15; the gate was 360,000× too wide, on the very property that enforces §1b's law. |
| `test-expfam/ExpFam.hs` | **retire group 6** (sufficiency-as-guarantee); **KEEP E7** | **§2a.** Sufficiency is false for an arbitrary code. E7 survives as **the model of the law**. |

**RETIRED — they pin a calculator:** `ladder`, `prepost`, `cirl`, `govhost`, `test-d`, and
the action-dependent parts of `membrane`. Two are hard blockers *by construction*:
`test-membrane/Membrane.hs:340-350` (the M5 guardian, which asserts menu growth ≠ namespace
growth) and `:156-159` (the t1 parity world, which publishes three affordances while pricing
against a singleton namespace).

**Frozen prose — the amendment SCHEDULE (ruled 2026-07-15, decision 10, superseding "at
this boundary"). The discipline: amend at the step that falsifies — never before
(premature staleness), never after (red suites, dead evidence):**

| frozen prose | amend at |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` — the optimisation law + the R-D21 canonization (mechanical form) + the evidence-program protocol line | **step 2** |
| `test-expfam/ExpFam.hs` group 6 retirement (the re-open table above) | **step 3** — EXECUTED at the sentence freeze |
| `interface.md` (T1, the load-bearing clause's scope); `EXPFAM_PLAN.md` (T1, E9) | **step 3** — EXECUTED at the sentence freeze |
| `design.md` / `typed-port-spec.md` (the outcome sort; `prodTable` prose) | **each alphabet-moving step** (P5's own rhythm) |
| `membrane-wire.md` (the sentinel, `missing-internal-row`) | **step 5** — `host-governor/Wire.hs` DISCHARGED EARLY by retirement at step 3 (D3 rider 1); the sentinel's remaining pointable site is `membrane-wire.md:131` (the think row; prose at `:57`), which keeps its step-5 date |
| suite retirements (`ladder`, `prepost`, `cirl`, membrane's action parts) | **the step that falsifies each** (first: step 5 — the M5 guardian and the t1 parity world break by construction; `govhost` + `test-d` FELL AT STEP 3 with `Model` — the rule fired early, as designed; membrane's action rows were PORTED to the sentence route at the same freeze) |
| `HOSTS_PLAN.md` (M5) | **step 7** |
| `MANIFEST.sha256` | re-signed at every freeze (83 rows at `code-freeze-r1`) |

Every description length moves — the P5 alphabet-constant clause firing as designed. The
author has ruled the cost acceptable.

## 8b. RIDER 5 — the SUPERSESSION MAP (else "the M5 of process")

> *"§2a dissolves the substrate under the standing program without saying what becomes of it…
> Map each — **discharged by construction, re-based, or dead** — or the repo carries **two live
> roadmaps under one custody regime, which is the M5 of process.**"*

The standing chain is **V → R → K → change families** (`BRIEF_AUDIT.md:284-287`), plus HOSTS_PLAN's
**A / B / C**. Every one of them is touched. Mapped, with citations:

| standing item | scope, as written | disposition under §2a/§5 |
|---|---|---|
| **K — kernel decomposition** (`BRIEF_AUDIT.md:285`; A2's DEBT row `:29`) | *"`rw` becomes a stdlib name over utterable, individually priced, individually deletion-proven kernel atoms `mix`/`step`/`id`"* (`:57-60`). Census-bearing, demand-gated. | **DISCHARGED BY CONSTRUCTION.** A code sentence **is** that decomposition — priced, utterable, deletion-provable, atom by atom. **A2's DEBT row (*"molecule recorded as an atom — SELF-LICENSED"*) closes at §2a, not at K.** K's separate census never falls due. |
| **the KER sort "becoming generative after decomposition"** (`BRIEF_AUDIT.md:62`) | K's census scopes *"the kernel-enumeration frontier"* | **DEAD AS WORDED.** KER stays a **1-production sort** (`ExpFam` → `Code`); it is `Code`'s **body** that is generative, priced by the ordinary EXPR table. The frontier is the enumerator's, and it stays **open research** (§9 OPEN 7). |
| **R — vocabulary purchase / refinement** (`METAREASONING_PLAN.md:284`) | *"`refine` as the second internal act valued by V's machinery"*; *"**R buys PRECISION, not adaptation**"* (`:37`) | **RE-BASED, and SIMPLER.** Vocabulary purchase becomes **grid refinement over code constants** — one law for all mentions, no per-family special case. |
| **the "natural-parameter amendment"** — the author's own (`METAREASONING_PLAN.md:372-373`) | *"the alphabet law is stated in criterion form: the dyadic lattice in **the family's NATURAL PARAMETER**, or the feature's canonical coordinate — log-odds is the Bernoulli instance, not the law"* | **DISSOLVES — exactly as the author said, and the text convicts itself.** It says *"the family's"*. **§2a abolishes families.** There is no natural parameter to take a lattice in; there is a **code length in bits**, and the lattice is over *that*. The amendment was a correct generalisation **of a substrate that is being deleted.** |
| **change families** (`BRIEF_AUDIT.md:208-212`, D2/D3) | *"is BOCPD already utterable as mix-over-regime-kernels with a hazard weight from **K's atoms**? … The brief's method applied to its own roadmap."* | **RE-BASED — and D3's own collapse-check now answers YES.** The question was posed *"after K"*, against K's atoms. §2a supplies them. **Change families become code sentences with latents** — a hypothesis is a sentence, so a regime mixture is one too. |
| **C — arithmetic** (`HOSTS_PLAN.md:798-801`) | *"the census-bearing boundary, **last**"*; **GATE**: *"C is built only if D's oracle demonstrates step-table underfit"* | **RE-BASED, AND ITS GATE IS DEAD.** §5: arithmetic is forced **by the likelihood**, not by utility underfit. **C's demand-gate was watching the wrong quantity** and would never have fired for the reason that actually forces it. **C moves from LAST-and-conditional to FIRST-and-unconditional** (step 1). |
| **A — K-ary observations** (`HOSTS_PLAN.md:509-513`) | *"K-ary observation is **NOT a grammar change**"*; demand-gated on the life-agent differential | **SURVIVES, UNCHANGED.** Orthogonal to §2a — it is about the observation *space*, not the likelihood's *form*. Still demand-gated. |
| **B — reliability / noisy channel** (`HOSTS_PLAN.md:583-587`) | conditional on A's differential showing a reliability shortfall | **SURVIVES, and gets EASIER.** A noisy channel is **a code** (§2a) — a finite mixture, no longer a special family needing its own boundary. If it lands at all, it lands as a sentence. |
| **V — the single decision rule at the wire** (`METAREASONING_PLAN.md:10-11`) | tag **`v-open` EXISTS; there is NO `v-freeze`.** | ⚠️ **DEAD — AND DANGLING RIGHT NOW.** Its entire subject (`VThink`/`VThinkK`/`VPre`) is **deleted** by proof (i). **This is a live custody defect the map surfaces: an OPEN boundary tag with no freeze and no cancellation.** **V must be formally CANCELLED by the author at this boundary**, or the repo carries an open boundary whose subject no longer exists. |

**Also stale and named:** `BRIEF_AUDIT.md:143-147` prices nodes at `nodeB = lg 10` and quotes
`ProdTable 10 2 1 1 7 1` verbatim; `:21-22` prices `Bern` at `lg 10 + lg 5`. **Both go stale the
moment `prodExpr` moves 10 → 20 and four sorts vanish.** They are *audit* rows, not oracle pins —
but an audit that cites dead prices is not an audit. *(Discharged 2026-07-15, decision 12:
BRIEF_AUDIT now carries a dated supersession header — a dated audit is a record, not an
oracle; prepend, never rewrite.)*

**Custody home for the survivors (added 2026-07-15, decision 11):** R-rebased (vocabulary
purchase as grid refinement over code constants), change families, A, and B are
**POST-ROADMAP demand-gated boundaries** — each opens oracle-first under its own tag when
its gate fires; none is a step of this plan. The founding grids' DEBT rows
(`BRIEF_AUDIT.md` A4–A6) **transfer to R-rebased**; they stay printed under BRIEF_AUDIT's
supersession header, which is what keeps "no deadline" from decaying into "forgotten".

## 8c. RIDER 5's process rule → **CLAUDE.md**

The author, on the silence paragraph:

> *"every **type** on a frozen surface gets a one-line derivation from the brief, **the typing
> complement of §5b's deletion audit** — **it was a type, not a terminal, that hid the calculator
> for 86 commits.**"*

**This is the single most valuable process output of the episode, and it goes into frozen
`CLAUDE.md` at this boundary.**

> **THE TYPE-DERIVATION AUDIT.** Every **type** on a frozen surface carries a one-line derivation
> from the brief, exactly as every **terminal** carries a one-line deletion proof (§5b). A type
> without one is cut, or the brief is amended to license it.

**Why it is the exact fix for the exact failure.** §0's silence paragraph: the increment protocol
scrutinises **changes**, and `data Util a y` arrived **on day zero, as a port**. Eighty-six
commits, forty documents, two external reviews and a brief-conformance audit all pointed at
everything downstream of that line and never at the line. **The deletion audit polices the
alphabet. Nothing policed the types.** `Util a y` was not a terminal — it was a *type* — and it
carried the entire calculator.

---

## 9. Under-determination register

**RULED.** The world's determinism is moot (A3) — `s` is not in the agent's ontology.
CL-3 first-listed-wins stands. `wait` is core, always available (A5).

**RULED 2026-07-12 (author):**

- **THE OPTIMISATION LAW.** *"Optimisations can exploit structure but never live in the
  prior."* See **§1b** — the repo already calls it "the doctrine" in three places and never
  made it a law. It costs no speed and it convicts `Bern`.
- **Arithmetic IS blocking. (This REVERSES the builder's own correction of two days ago,
  which was wrong.)** Not because of utility — the decision-tree argument stands — but because
  **a code length is an arithmetic expression** (§2a) and **`verdictKernel` calls `bernFast` at
  a computed, off-grid θ**, which no table can stand in for. See **§5**.
- **No conventions.** `wait` is the first grid point, world-declared — not the dormancy
  default. See §5c.
- **CL-1 at the echo.** The criterion is **the membrane itself**: *is it observable from
  outside?* Your **actions** are (the world watched you). Your **posterior entropy** is not.
  **Measured runtime** is (the clock ran). So actions and measured compute-cost may be
  features; `entropyBits` and `top` may not — and the value of waiting is re-derived
  **through the verbs**, which is CL-1's own escape clause satisfied explicitly rather than
  by assertion. `ticks_spent_thinking` is deleted regardless (a designer-chosen sufficient
  statistic). **No document in this repo had ever cited CL-1 at the echo. This is that
  ruling.**
  ✅ **ENDORSED BY THE AUTHOR (2026-07-12)**: *"the cleanest piece of new law in the document,
  and it is exactly how 'measured compute cost' enters without a fabricated number."* **Kept
  verbatim; no rider touches it.**
- **Primitivity.** Every surviving production gets a deletion proof — including the ones
  that never had one. See §5b. **RIDER 5 adds its complement: every TYPE on a frozen surface
  gets a one-line derivation from the brief (§8c).**

**OPEN.**

1. **Does `Event` survive as a peer noun?** With `Expect` binding its variable, `FnInd` is
   just an `If`-indicator, so `prob` is derivable. brief §3 left this open deliberately
   (*"make the argument yourself and record which cost you chose to pay"*).
   **Due: step 9** (ruled 2026-07-15, decision 5) — the deletion + type-derivation audit
   is where `prob`'s derivability is executed, not argued.
2. **The gauge.** `E[ΔU]` is gauge-free in the additive constant but not the scale. What
   fixes the scale — the principal's revealed indifference, or a declared unit?
   **Due: step 8** (ruled 2026-07-15, decision 5) — the scale question is CIRL's own; the
   as-built answer (zero + dollar-slope, R-D7) dies with the step table there.
3. **`Push` vs `Expect`.** brief §4 calls them **one verb** (*"prediction is `push` into ℝ —
   the operation you will elsewhere call `expect`"*). In the typed port they are two
   constructors because the codomains differ (a `Belief` vs a scalar). The builder's reading:
   that is an **encoding artifact, not a fourth verb** — but the prior charges two codewords
   for it, so the author should record which cost was chosen.
   **Due: step 9** (ruled 2026-07-15, decision 5) — `Expect` gains its binder exactly
   there; the cost choice is recorded in the same freeze.
4. **~~`fromBits` has two unguarded hazards, and §2a makes both reachable.~~ — ✅ RULED at
   code-freeze-r0 (pack §6.10 items 2–3, on the §6 evidence program).** Reading (iii):
   `Code`'s codomain is `Expr env (Maybe (K a b))`, validated eagerly at eval and refused
   EXACTLY on a NaN/−∞ entry or a massless (all-+∞) column — the partiality lives in the
   type at the one door where arbitrary arithmetic enters. `fromBits` and `Kernel` stay
   frozen as shipped; `Belief.hs:101-103` remains a theorem. Every `L` in `[0, +∞]`
   denotes — hard zeros and negative-by-ulp `L` included, because the frozen ExpFam node
   itself computes negative `L` in 4 of 18 cells (pack §6.5): **strict L ≥ 0 was never
   available.** `test-code` group 7 pins both sides of the boundary. *(The original row's
   text is preserved above the strikethrough date in the pack's §4 R-C1.)*
5. **~~The minimal arithmetic set.~~ — ✅ RULED at code-freeze-r0 (pack §6.10 item 5).** The
   step-1 oracle confirms the seven; **`Neg` STAYS** — the sign of zero is measured CONTENT,
   not sugar: the retire case's premise ("no lawful posterior changes") was falsified by the
   builder's own experiment (pack §6.6 — a lawful pair differing ONLY in `Neg` vs
   `Sub`-with-dormancy-zero separates the posterior to `[1, 0]`). Keeping it costs 0.0781
   bits/node and flips no strict ordering (§6.7). `prodExpr` is **19** at step 1 (this
   document's intermediate alphabet), on the way to §5b's 21.
6. **~~`Pos`: index or value?~~ — ✅ ANSWERED BY EXECUTION (§5d), and the answer was BOTH.**
   This row asked the right question and **the builder ignored his own register**: §5b asserted
   `Pos` subsumes `Stats`/`SId` while OPEN 6, two sections later, said the coincidence it relied on
   *"is not a theorem"*. **The oracle prototypes settled it: `SId` is `realToFrac` (`Eval.hs:168`)
   — a VALUE — and `Pos` is a POSITION. Neither subsumes the other; both are forced.** `ToR` joins
   the alphabet (EXPR 21). **The `Space Double` escape was executed and REJECTED: it breaks
   `test-hygiene/Hygiene.hs:143` (`fromIntegral (y :: Obs)` needs `Integral Obs`) and
   `test/Acceptance.hs` — both declared survivors.**
   **The lesson, and it is the one worth keeping: a register row is only worth what the argument
   two sections earlier is checked against.**
   **RULED at code-freeze-r0 (the author's review, 2026-07-13): "answered by execution" was an
   execution note, not a ruling, and an alphabet member had entered without one — the resolution
   now STANDS AS AN AUTHOR RULING: `Pos` and `ToR` both, two productions; the §5b delta
   EXPR 20 → 21 is a DECLARED alphabet change; `ToR` carries its deletion proof in §5b's
   primitivity audit (added at the same review).**
7. **The generator stays open.** The Cromwell frontier is **named open research**
   (`design.md:244`, `WRITEUP.md:414`). This boundary does **not** solve it and does not pretend
   to: the enumerator will produce codes from a **declared, depth-bounded fragment**, and today's
   three families must fall out of it. **If the bounded enumeration cannot reproduce a working
   hypothesis space, stop and report.**

**OPENED BY THE AUTHOR'S RIDERS (2026-07-12) — the four that were not open before:**

8. **⚠️ MULTI-STEP VALUE — the myopia (RIDER 1).** `E[ΔU]` as built is **one tick's Δ**. §3 convicts
   `last_action` because *"a consequence can land five ticks later"* — and latent-carrying
   hypotheses duly **learn** arbitrary lag — **but a consequence at `t+5` is then visible to
   learning and INVISIBLE TO CHOICE.** The lazy-genius test **does not catch this**: `hazard` folds
   the future into the present tick.
   - **Already sayable:** depth-unrolling. Proof (i)'s `sPre m` builds a depth-`m` lookahead from
     `Push`/`Cond`/`Expect`/`Argmax` alone.
   - **Not sayable:** the **world-rollforward**. A hypothesis is `context → Obs`, **not an
     endo-kernel on features**, so pushing it five times **is not type-correct.** There is no
     kernel-composition and no recursion production among the 21.
   - **The horizon must never be a CONSTANT** — *"the sentinel's disease returning"* (the author).
     Nor need it be: **a depth-`k` unrolled sentence costs `O(k)` nodes, so deeper lookahead is
     DEARER IN THE PRIOR.** The bound is already paid in bits; *choosing* the depth is an **act**,
     priced by the clock (A7).
   - **RULED (author): print the myopia as a scope line + the falsifier** — *a payoff-at-`t+5`
     world where one-step `E[ΔU]` provably selects the dominated act* (step 8b). The
     kernel-composition production stays the **named alternative**, to land only with its deletion
     proof. **No production lands on the builder's judgement.**
9. **⚠️ `do()` / EVIDENTIAL SCORING — downgraded RULED → OPEN (RIDER 3).** Push-at-assignment is
   **evidential** scoring. The enumerator **must** produce action–latent-correlated hypotheses (to
   model the confound §3 itself names) — and then conditioning on a *contemplated* action updates
   latents **through the back-channel**: **smoking-lesion territory, the agent managing the news
   rather than the world.** *"The posterior arbitrates, exploration escapes"* is an **asymptotic**
   defence; **the transient can be dominated for as long as the confound persists.** The author:
   *"manipulation-shaped problems need **path-specific objectives, not alphabet rules**."*
   **Falsifier owed (step 6b): a confounded-payoff world; measure whether AND WHEN exploration
   pressure rescues the choice — and at what regret.**
10. **`ElimJ`'s `Nothing` branch — a totality story is owed (RIDER 5's sibling; OPEN 4's).** `cond`
    returns `Maybe`, so `ElimJ` must answer for the impossible-evidence case. **In proof (i) the
    default sat under a weight-zero predictive, so its VALUE was inert — that is an accident of the
    preposterior, not a general licence.** In a general sentence the default is **load-bearing**.
    Branches: a **sentence-level arm** (both arms supplied by the program), or a **world-declared
    grid point** (§5c's discipline). **Never a baked constant.**
    **Due: step 9, IN `ElimJ`'s landing oracle** (ruled 2026-07-15, decision 5) — the
    totality story is part of the landing, never after.
11. **A5's delegation (RIDER 4).** §5c gives **`argmax` totality**, not **inaction**. A world
    declaring `fire :| [stand_down]` makes the first grid point a **launch**. **Inaction semantics
    is delegated to world authors** — lawful (world content is physics) but **a convention
    relocated across the membrane, not abolished.** Recorded, not narrowed. Does the author accept
    the delegation, or does the membrane owe a *declared* inaction row?
    **✅ RULED 2026-07-15 (design-review gate, decision 1): the delegation is ACCEPTED.**
    Under A3 the agent has no ontology in which "nothing happened" is distinguished, and a
    declared inaction row would re-install the convention §5c deleted. **The cost line,
    recorded verbatim as the register's protection against someone later "fixing" it: a
    world CAN make its first grid point a launch — that is the world author's declaration,
    visible in the hello, priced like everything else.**
12. **V is DANGLING (RIDER 5's map, §8b).** Tag **`v-open` exists; there is no `v-freeze`** — and
    proof (i) **deletes V's entire subject** (`VThink`/`VThinkK`/`VPre`). **The author must
    formally CANCEL V at this boundary**, or the repo carries an open boundary whose subject no
    longer exists. *(A live custody defect, surfaced by the map rather than by anyone noticing.)*
    **✅ DISCHARGED 2026-07-15 (design-review gate, decision 2).** The author signed
    `v-cancelled` on `ea891f0` from his own shell; verified: *Good "git" signature for
    guy@publicdatamarket.com, ED25519 SHA256:Sfh8OBG9CtkTF/y8rch4Cf6wv1rCpJ8ymEtKilUucsY*.
    V is formally cancelled; the boundary closed without a freeze. No dangling boundary
    tag remains.

## 10. Custody

Builder signs with the builder key (`/home/g/.ssh/proplang-builder.pub`), never the
author's. This boundary binds when the author countersigns with a signed tag from the
author's own shell. The tag, not any commit signature, is the attestation.

**RULED BY THE AUTHOR, 2026-07-12: the author tags this boundary HIMSELF.** CLAUDE.md's delegation
route (*"the builder then tags with the BUILDER key and records the delegation verbatim"*) **was
available and was declined.** No delegated tag exists on this boundary; **R-D22's re-tag obligation
never arises, because the builder makes no delegated edit to a frozen surface.** The builder
commits the riders with the builder key and **stops.**

---

## 11. The author's riders (2026-07-12) — recorded verbatim

> *"This is the strongest document in the sequence, and the diagnosis is correct… **Sign it — with
> the following riders, ranked.**"*

The author's verdict on the rest: the chain from **Savage-as-definition to the fabricated sentinel**
is *"evidenced link by link"*; the silence paragraph *"identifies the real process lesson: **day-zero
ports evade an increment protocol, and a conformance audit checks the laws you thought to write,
never the types you inherited**"*; and **proof (i) is *"the quiet star"*** — *"VOI reproduced as an
ordinary sentence to one ulp retroactively vindicates 'the generator is just the one argmax' and
discharges the brief's own named forbidden move."*

| # | rider | disposition |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | **A1 fixes the model side's lag problem and leaves it standing on the value side.** *"a consequence landing at t+5 is visible to learning and invisible to choice… The lazy-genius test dodges this because hazard folds the future into the present tick… **Any horizon constant, note, would be the sentinel's disease returning.**"* | **ACCEPTED — LIVE DEFECT.** §9 OPEN 8; step 8b; A1 scoped; proof (iii) scoped. **RULED: scope line + falsifier.** |
| **2** | **M5's repeal opens a coherence hole the plan doesn't pin.** *"two identical sentences enumerated either side of a publication carry different priors — path dependence… implementers will freeze enumeration-time prices and **ship the incoherence M5 was clumsily guarding against.**"* | **ACCEPTED — LIVE DEFECT.** §6 gains the **immutable-namespace pin** + the **wire consequence** + the author's fixture. Step 7. |
| **3** | **"No do()" is an OPEN row, not a ruling.** *"conditioning on a contemplated action updates latents through the back-channel — **smoking-lesion territory** … 'the posterior arbitrates, exploration escapes' is an **asymptotic** defence; **the transient can be dominated**."* | **ACCEPTED — DOWNGRADE.** §3 rewritten **RULED → OPEN**; §9 OPEN 9; step 6b. **This is the Savage move committed twice, by the same reflex.** |
| **4** | **§5c delivers totality, not inaction — say so.** *"a world listing `fire :| [stand_down]` makes your 'wait' a launch… otherwise the axiom overclaims."* | **ACCEPTED.** **A5 amended to its structural form**; the delegation named in §9 OPEN 11. |
| **5** | **The plan needs a supersession section.** *"…or the repo carries **two live roadmaps under one custody regime, which is the M5 of process.**"* | **ACCEPTED.** **§8b** — the full map (K/R/C/A/B/V/change-families/the natural-parameter amendment/BRIEF_AUDIT's stale rows), each cited. **§8c** — the type-derivation rule → CLAUDE.md. **It surfaced a live custody defect: `v-open` dangles.** |

**The smaller riders — all four accepted:**

| rider | disposition |
|---|---|
| *"`ElimJ`'s Nothing branch needs a totality story"* | §9 OPEN 10. **The proof-(i) default was inert only because it sat under a weight-zero predictive — an accident, not a licence.** |
| *"the CL-4 headroom was measured on today's engine, so **re-measure post-step-1** as an oracle row before freezing 1e-12"* | **ACCEPTED WITHOUT RESERVATION.** Step 1. `Code` + arithmetic changes the arithmetic; the 363× margin is not transferable. |
| *"'strictly fewer deliberating ticks' fails between hazard 0.4 and 0.7 — **delete 'strictly'**"* | **ACCEPTED — the document's own table refutes the document's own adverb.** 0.400 → 1 and 0.700 → 1. §4 now says **monotone (never more)** and **prints the tie**. |
| *"the silence paragraph deserves its generalised rule in CLAUDE.md: **every type on a frozen surface gets a one-line derivation from the brief** … it was a **type, not a terminal**, that hid the calculator for 86 commits"* | **ACCEPTED — §8c.** The typing complement of the deletion audit, into frozen `CLAUDE.md`. **The single most valuable process output of this episode.** |

**Endorsed, untouched:** the **CL-1-at-the-echo** ruling — *"the cleanest piece of new law in the
document, and it is exactly how 'measured compute cost' enters without a fabricated number."*

## 12. What the author must still do

*(Amended at the design-review gate, 2026-07-15 — S1: item 2 had gone stale.)*

1. **§9 OPEN 11 — ✅ RULED 2026-07-15** (the delegation accepted; cost line recorded in
   the row). **§9 OPEN 12 — ✅ DISCHARGED 2026-07-15**: `v-cancelled` signed on `ea891f0`
   from the author's own shell, verified. **This list is now empty.**
2. **Sign — ✅ DONE**: `agent-boundary` (`f46e08c`) + `agent-boundary-r1` (the §5d R-D22
   re-tag), both verified. The author acts hereafter are per-step: each increment's freeze
   tag, and the R-D22 re-tag covering the 2026-07-15 amendment commit (riding step 2's
   freeze).
